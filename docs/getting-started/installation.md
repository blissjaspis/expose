# Installation

## PHP Archive (PHAR)
We distribute Expose as a PHAR archive that contains everything you need in order to use Expose. Simply download it from [here]() and make it executable:

```
wget -O expose https://link-to-expose

chmod +x expose

./expose
```

You most likely want to put the `expose` program into a directory on your `PATH`, so you can simply call expose from any directory. For example:

```
sudo mv expose /usr/local/bin/expose
```

After that, you are ready to go and can [share your first site](/docs/getting-started/sharing-your-first-site).
 
## Via Composer
Expose is a PHP application and you can install the client for your local machine as a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require beyondcode/expose
```

Make sure that your global composer directory is inside of your `PATH` environment variable.
Simply add this directory to your `PATH` in your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.bashrc`) like this:

```
export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

## Building from Source

If you're working with the Expose source code and want to create a new build, use the following command:

```bash
php expose app:build expose
```

This will create a new executable in the `builds/expose` directory.

To make the built executable available globally, create a symbolic link to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/builds/expose" /usr/local/bin/tunnel
```

After building and installing globally, don't forget to configure the client for your self-hosted server by modifying the configuration file at `~/.expose/config.php`. Update the `host` and `port` settings to point to your self-hosted Expose server.

## As a docker container

Expose has a `Dockerfile` in the root of the source that you can build and use without any extra effort.

```bash
docker build -t expose .
```

Usage:

```bash
docker run expose <expose command>
```

Examples:

```bash
docker run expose share http://192.168.2.100 # share a local site
docker run expose serve my-domain.com # start a server
```

Now you're ready to go and can [share your first site](/docs/expose/getting-started/sharing-your-first-site).


### Extending Expose

By default, Expose comes as an executable PHAR file. This allows you to use all Expose features out of the box – without any additional setup required.

If you want to modify Expose and want to add custom request/response modifiers, you need to clone the GitHub repository instead of the global composer dependency.

You can learn more about the customization of Expose in the [extending Expose](/docs/expose/extending-the-server/subdomain-generator) documentation section.
